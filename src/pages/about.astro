			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				I'm <strong>Ashish Bhutani</strong> — a Senior Backend Engineer and GenAI Platform Architect.
				I've spent years building and debugging backend systems, and more recently, I've been deep in the
				trenches of GenAI infrastructure: designing LLM serving pipelines, debugging inference latencies,
				and figuring out how to make these systems actually work at scale.
			</p>

			<h2>What this blog is about</h2>
			<p>
				This blog is my attempt to write down the stuff I wish someone had told me earlier. If you're a
				backend or platform engineer trying to break into GenAI, or prepping for a system design interview
				with an ML/AI focus, this is for you.
			</p>
			<p>
				Every post is written to be <strong>interview-ready</strong> — I start with real debugging scenarios
				and production trade-offs, not textbook theory. Topics include LLM inference optimization, speculative
				decoding, KV cache management, GPU serving, and all the infrastructure that makes GenAI work in production.
			</p>

			<h2>Why I'm writing this</h2>
			<p>
				I noticed a gap: there's plenty of academic content about transformers and attention mechanisms,
				but not enough practical, "here's what actually breaks in production" content for engineers.
				That's what I'm trying to fill.
